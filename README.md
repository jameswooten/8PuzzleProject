# 8-Puzzle Game A* Project 1 ITCS 6150
# James Wooten

This program simulates the 8-Puzzle game and solves the puzzle to reach the goal state
by using two different heuristics. It will solve the first pass by using the Manhattan 
heuristic and the second pass using the Hamming heuristic. It will then print out the 
results for each method and display the path to reach the goal, the number of nodes expanded, and the number of nodes in the frontier.


## How to enter your grids

Example:
"1"
"2"
"3"                                    ------

"6"                                   | 7 8 0 |
"7"                                    ------
